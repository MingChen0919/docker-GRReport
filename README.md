## Galaxy R Markdown Tools

Galaxy R Markdown Tools use R markdown as a framework to wrap multiple tools and/or scripts from different 
programming languages into a single tool and generate an R markdown document in the format of either single HTML or a web site. 
Technically, all Galaxy tools can be wrapped in the R Markdown framework to provide well-organized HTML outputs with better
data visualization.
